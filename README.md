# Suduku Game
This is an ongoing project/exercise.
What I'm trying to accomplish here is a simple sudoku game generator from scratch, without any prior knowledge of how it should be done, so I expect to make a lot errors.<br>
I started by creating a (9, 9) 2D array, and then, applying permutations. Later, I tried using Latin Squares.
It's actually much tougher than I thought.
Anyway, every new version of the sudokuXX.py file is a different aproach to solve the problem.
